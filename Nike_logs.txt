   ```
   It’s big, big news when two household names join forces. That’s true at Nike & Jordan World of Flight Mexico City, where the two brands have teamed up in the famed Centro Histórico neighborhood to form NIKE Inc.’s only dual-brand presence, opening on July 11. At more than 22,000 square feet, it’s one of NIKE Inc.’s biggest retail spaces anywhere in the world. That story of twos also holds true for Alicia Nicollette Fucuy Arteaga, the retail destination’s Head Coach. For Alicia, her love of sport and her belief in positive leadership intersect through the responsibilities of her job, where she leads a talented team to help serve athletes across the Americas. From shooting hoops as a six-year-old alongside her father, to helping guide the future of sport retail for an entire continent, she’s embarked on a professional experience that’s brought together two of her biggest passions. For Alicia, that discovery has been life-changing. “As a leader, I’m very aware of the positive impact I can have on my team and on people who visit our store,” says Alicia. “I’m actually motivated by the challenges and lessons awaiting us as we begin here in Mexico City. That’s why being here as a Head Coach is the most rewarding professional experience of my life.” #WorldOfFlight #JustDoIt

Understand provided from the reference post in Friends,

I would like to share the 12th post in a new blog series called "Ask the Coach", which is inspired by the ongoing conversations I have with my network on career, life and leadership issues. 

I recently chatted with a former coaching client about the importance of being patient with others. From the post: "This busy senior leader in a large Atlanta-based company described his frustration and impatience with a number of people on his team and in his peer group. I listened carefully, then shared some hard-fought experience about being more patient with others from my own career and observations of others who I think do this well."

This post is a summary of the advice I offered this leader and a quick read which I hope you find helpful. Please leave your thoughts and comments below.

Thanks!
